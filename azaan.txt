<h2> Educatoin and interest:</h2>.
<p> I am studying in class 8 of school "Horizon High". I am interest in cars. i like supercars. The meaning of supercars is an expensive car that's flashy, fast, luxurious, and prestigious. Think of a supercar as top of the line â€” the best of the best.
While insurers have their definitions for supercars, you can generally expect to pay more for auto insurance if you own a luxury vehicle.</p>
